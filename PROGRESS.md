## Current Focus

The MVP implementation is complete. The system can now:
1. Accept video uploads with narration text
2. Process videos with narration in multiple languages
3. Store processed videos securely
4. Deliver videos with language switching capabilities
5. Provide embed codes for embedding videos elsewhere

## Next Steps

1. Implement integration tests
2. Create deployment scripts for cloud environments
3. Implement analytics and usage tracking
4. Add user authentication and permissions
5. Enhance the admin interface with more features

## Known Issues

Potential areas for improvement:
- Cleanup utilities for temporary files are not fully implemented
- No automated testing suite yet
- System requires proper API keys for Google Translate and ElevenLabs

## Implementation Notes

### Session: 2025-04-10 (Part 1)
- Completed the upload service implementation with file handling and validation
- Implemented the processing service with translation, TTS, and video processing
- Created the delivery service with video playback and embedding support
- Added a basic admin interface for uploading and managing videos
- Updated the main application to coordinate all services

### Session: 2025-04-10 (Part 2)
- Updated environment configuration for Digital Ocean resources
- Created GitHub repository for the project: video-narration-service (private)
- Due to nested directory structure issues, planned to reorganize project into a clean directory
- Updated configuration to use proper Digital Ocean resource names:
  - Database: video-player-db
  - Redis: db-redis-nyc3-video-player
  - Storage Space: video-player-narrations

## Notes for Future Sessions

The MVP implementation is complete and all core components are functioning. The next steps are focused on deployment to Digital Ocean.

### Next Session To-Do:
1. Start a new Claude Code session in the clean directory:
   ```
   cd "/Users/keithkrugh/Atlas Health Dropbox/Keith Krugh/video-narration-service-clean"
   claude-code
   ```

2. Complete the GitHub repository setup from the clean directory structure
3. Set up the Digital Ocean App Platform deployment
4. Configure environment variables in Digital Ocean
5. Test the deployed application

### Directory Restructuring Plan:
1. Create and copy all project files to a new clean directory:
   ```
   mkdir -p "/Users/keithkrugh/Atlas Health Dropbox/Keith Krugh/video-narration-service-clean"
   
   # Copy essential files (excluding the nested directory and system files)
   cp -R "/Users/keithkrugh/Atlas Health Dropbox/Keith Krugh/video-narration-service/"*.{md,js,json} \
         "/Users/keithkrugh/Atlas Health Dropbox/Keith Krugh/video-narration-service/"{.gitignore,migrations,public,src} \
         "/Users/keithkrugh/Atlas Health Dropbox/Keith Krugh/video-narration-service-clean/"
   ```

2. Initialize Git in the clean directory:
   ```
   cd "/Users/keithkrugh/Atlas Health Dropbox/Keith Krugh/video-narration-service-clean"
   git init
   ```
   
3. Link to the GitHub repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/video-narration-service.git
   ```
   
4. Commit and push the initial code:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Video Narration Service MVP"
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   
5. Continue with Digital Ocean deployment setup

### Important Digital Ocean Resources:
- App name: video-player-backend
- Database: video-player-db
- Redis: db-redis-nyc3-video-player
- Storage Space: video-player-narrations

To resume development after deployment:
1. Review this PROGRESS.md file to understand what's been completed
2. Check ARCHITECTURE.md for the overall system design
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application locally for testing
4. Make sure all required API keys are set in your .env file
